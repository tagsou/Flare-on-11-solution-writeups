![flare-on](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1f17a2e-842c-49ad-ae1f-65163fc0e506)


I particited in my first flare-on challenge. 
I was only able to finish up to challenge 7 of the 10 but I will still take that as an achievement since I'm still pretty new to Reverse engineering and didnt have much time towards the end. 
definitely one of the hardest CTFs I have played but learnt a lot and had made me enjoy playing CTFs again. I really recommend those who are interested in malware analysis or reverse engineering give Flare-on a go!
